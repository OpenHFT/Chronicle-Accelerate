= XCL Block Chain
Peter Lawrey

The XCL Block Chain is an ordered collection of messages as commands + events and queries + responses. Its structure contains:

- Signed Messages.
- A Transaction Block which is a list of messages produced by a single node.
- A End of Round Block which describes the order of these blocks.

All data is in little endian. All strings use UTF-8 encoding.

NOTE: Events must come from a trusted source.
i.e. a recognised node in the current cluster, or a recognised node in the previous week's cluster.

== Message header

=== Source Address

The source address is the address associated with the signer of this message.

For administration messages, this is the server which is performing the function.

For transfers and exchanges, it is the address the money comes from.

=== Event time

This is the time in micro-seconds for GMT, the message was send. The timestamp must be unique for a given source address. If two events are sent in quick succession, or the machine doesn't have micro-second resolution timer, the time must be incremented until the system time is greater.

In many cases this source address & event time combination identifies which command or query triggers an event or response.

=== Protocol or Schema version

Messages are grouped into a schema or protocol version. Initially, all messages have version 1.

However over time the schema could be updated, or new groups of messages could be added.

Version 0 is reserved as invalid.

Version 1 - 1023 is reserved for standard system messages.

Version 1024 - 65535 is available for user defined schema.

=== Message types

Message types are defined in the https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Accelerate/blob/master/api/src/main/java/cash/xcl/api/dto/MethodIds.java[MethodIds] class.

=== Trailing zeros

All messages have notionally endless zeros at the end.
If the schema changes and a field is added, it should be filled with 0 bytes; i.e. false, empty string, 0, or 0.0 as appropriate.
If the message sent has more bytes than expected, they may be silently ignored.

NOTE: The signature will always include only the bytes actually written and not include the notional extra zero bytes.

== Message format

=== Signed Messages

Messages written are either commands (an instruction to take an action which might be rejected), or events (something which has happened, might not need an action but cannot be rejected).

The message format looks like:

[width="80%",cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Byte offset | Field
| 0 - 63 | Signature
| 64 - 71 | Source address
| 72 - 79 | Event timestamp
| 80 - 81 | Protocol or schema version == 1 (1)
| 82 - 83 | Message type (for version)
| 84+ | The rest of the message depending on the message type
|===
<1> In the future, two protocol versions might be supported while an old one is deprecated.

For any given

=== Transaction Block Event (message type = 0x01)

The transaction block is a signed message which contains zero or more messages.

[width="80%",cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Byte offset | Field
|  0 - 63 | Signature
| 64 - 71 | Source address
| 72 - 79 | Event timestamp
| 80 - 81 | Protocol or schema version == 1
| 82 - 83 | Message type (for version) == 0x01
| 84 - 87 | Week number
| 88 - 91 | Block in week for source (1) (2)
| 92+ | The first message
| Later | Additional messages
|===
<1> Allows for 4 billion blocks per week, per source.
<2> Blocks must be monotonically increasing from 0 at the start of the week.

Within the transaction block, each message is preceded by a message length which is 2 byte unsigned length.

=== Transaction Block Gossip Event (message type = 0x02)

The message publishes which blocks this node has received.

=== Transaction Block Vote Event (message type = 0x03)

The message publishes a vote on what the next End of Round Block Event should be.

=== End Of Round Block Event (message type = 0x04)

The transaction block is a signed message which contains zero or more messages.

[width="80%",cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Byte offset | Field
| 0 - 79 | Message header
| 80 - 81 | Protocol or schema version == 1
| 82 - 83 | Message type (for version) == 0x04
| 84 - 87 | Week number
| 88 - 91 | Block in week for source
| 92+ | The first vote
| Later | Additional copies of votes

It is also the event produced at the end of the week to record the balance.

This message: 

 - is an event to set the initial state of an address.
 - is dumped as part of the snap shot at the end of each week and loaded at the start of the next week.
 - must come from a trusted source or it will be rejected.

The message contains:

- the list of currencies and balances

=== Fees Event (0x06)

This event records the fee structure determined by the AI at the start of the week.

This event lists all the weekly exchange rates with mid price. It is used to calculate fees when the balance is in other currencies.

=== Service Nodes Event (0x08)

This event lists all the nodes in a cluster for a service.

=== Block Subscription Query (0x0f)

Requests a block be sent from a given block number in a week, for that node.

== Runtime Events

These events can occur at any time and on any chain.

=== Application Message Event (0x10)

This event records that something went wrong, most likely unable to be handled automatically.

When an event fails to be processed, it could trigger one of these events.

=== Command Failed Message Event (0x11)

This event records that an error occured processing a command in a way which might be processed automatically.

When a command fails to be processed it could trigger one of these events.

=== Query Failed Response (0x12)

When a query fails to be processed it could trigger one of these events.

NOTE: Responses are not written to a chain, only the connection sending the query.

== Main Chain Command/Queries

Main Chain Commands are commands which are used to execute Global operations; i.e. operations which apply to all regions in the world. The results of executing these commands are new transactions being executed and then persisted to the Main Blockchain. The Main Blockchain holds cross-regional data like ...
