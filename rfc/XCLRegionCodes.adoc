= Region Codes 0.1
Peter Lawrey

Each service is designated to a region, or a set of regions.

== Region Codes

Region codes are based on ISO-3166 region codes with some additional services:

- codes starting with a letter are regional country codes.
- codes starting with a 2-currency are exchange "regions".
- codes starting with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 are reserved for additional services.

== Region Specification

Each region service manages a range of regions based on the following format, as a 32-bit unsigned value:

|===
| Bits | Description
| 31 - 5 | Region base
| 4 - 0 | Mask bits
|===

e.g. The region `gbldn/25` could be London in the UK, with a mask of 25 bits.

== Region splitting

Initially the only region is 0x00000000 with match every region.

However once this is split in two you get:

```
0x00000001
 - 0x00000002
 - 0x40000002
0x80000001
 - 0x80000002
   - 0x80000003
     - 0x80000004
     - 0x90000004
   - 0xA0000003
- 0xC0000002
  - 0xC0000003
    - 0xC0000004
      - 0xC0000005
      - 0xC8000005
        - 0xC8000006
        - 0xCC000006
    - 0xD0000004
  - 0xE0000003
```
